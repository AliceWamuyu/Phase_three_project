# Understanding the Uptake of Vaccination among Demographic Features

Author: Alice Wanjiru Wamuyu



## Overview

This Analysis aims to understand the correlation between individuals' backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors and their personal vaccination patterns. The research will use data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey to predict the likelihood of people receiving a vaccine. The results of this study will provide valuable insights for future public health efforts in the fight against COVID-19.
## Problem definition

The global population's successful vaccination against COVID-19 is a major challenge facing public health efforts. An understanding of the factors that influence people's personal vaccination patterns, such as their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors, can help guide future public health strategies. The study will address this issue by using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey to predict the probability of an individual receiving a vaccine, which will provide valuable information for future public health efforts.
## Modeling and Evaluation

Using the processed data, I was able to train a logistic model, decision tree model and a Random Forest model.
I evaluated each of the modelsâ€™ performance using appropriate metrics such the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score. The best performing model was the Logistic model with the following metrics.

## Conclusion

The results of this project provide valuable insights into the correlation between different factors and vaccine uptake. This information can be used to inform future public health efforts aimed at increasing the uptake of the COVID 19 Vaccine
